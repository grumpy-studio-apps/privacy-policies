- Your location is **never transmitted** to our servers
- Your location is **processed entirely on your device**
- Your location is **not linked to your identity**
- Your location is **not stored permanently**
- Location services can be disabled at any time in the app settings

### Local App Data

The app stores the following data locally on your device:
- **Station Preferences**: Your selected departure and destination stations
- **Theme Preference**: Your choice of light or dark mode
- **API Settings**: Your 511.org API key (if you provide a custom one)

## Advertising

This app displays advertisements to support free development and maintenance.

### Google AdMob

We use Google AdMob to display banner advertisements at the bottom of the main screen. AdMob may collect and process:

**Data Collected by AdMob**:
- Device advertising identifiers (IDFA/AAID, only if you grant tracking permission)
- IP address (for general location at city/country level)
- Device type, model, and operating system version
- App usage data and ad interaction data
- Approximate location based on IP address

**Ad Personalization & App Tracking Transparency**:

When you first open the app, iOS will ask for your tracking permission:

- **If you allow tracking**: Ads may be personalized based on your interests across apps and websites. This may result in more relevant ads and higher revenue to support the app.
- **If you deny tracking**: You'll see non-personalized ads that are contextually relevant but not based on your cross-app activity. The app will still function fully.

**Your Privacy Choices**:
- Control tracking permission in iOS Settings → Privacy & Security → Tracking → DudeWhereIsMyCaltrain
- Disable personalized ads system-wide in iOS Settings → Privacy & Security → Apple Advertising
- Reset your advertising identifier in iOS Settings → Privacy & Security → Apple Advertising → Reset Advertising Identifier

**Important Notes**:
- Ad revenue helps keep this app free for all users
- We do not receive any personally identifiable information from AdMob
- AdMob operates independently and has its own privacy practices
- Ads are served by Google's ad network and third-party advertisers
